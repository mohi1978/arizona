# arizona project

Welcome to Arizona project.

The Arizona project is just a simple project based on a famous 8-bit microcontroller very poppular in the twenties; the 68HC11F1 !
This project started in 1998 when I was student, I wanted to build a development system from scratch. 
I used for that many pretty good articles to assembly and to make it run. 

The following architecture presents a small development environment for Motorola's 68HC11F1 microcontroller.

It enables to :
- Assembly and compile ASM and C files
- Simulate 6811 in assembler
- Load bootloader and S19 Firmware in a easy way
